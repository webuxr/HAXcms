# HAXCMS
HAX CMS seeks to be the smallest possible back-end CMS to make HAX work and be able to build websites with it. Leveraging JSON Outline Schema, HAX is able to author multiple pages, which it then writes onto the file system. This way a slim server layer is just for basic authentication, knowing how to save files, and placing them in version control.

## Features
- All of HAX without a bloated CMS
- Incredibly simple, readable file structure of flat HTML files and lightning fast, high scale micro-sites
- cdn friendly configuration
- automatic PWA generation (future)
- clean, simple theme layer abstracted from content
- No database (simple `.json` files help manage the data)
- Files you can reach out and touch, fork, and theme with ease!
- Support for multiple sites
- automatic git repo creation and management (never touch commandline again, but dive in if you really needed)
- Built in gh-pages publishing

## Install and win the future, NOW!
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms.git`
- Install a server container (recomnended). Here are some options (We support 'em all!):
 - [docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
 - [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)
 - [docksal](https://docksal.io/installation/)
 - [lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html)
 - [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- Open a terminal window, go to the directory where you downloaded your container app and type `ddev start` (for ddev) or `fin init` (for docksal) or `lando start && lando magic` (for lando) or `vagrant up` (for vagrant).
- Go to the link any of them give you in a browser.
- Username/password is `admin`/`admin` to get building out static sites locally that you can push up anywhere!
- Click the icon in the top-right and you're off and running!

## Scope
Generate `.html` files which have only "content" in them. Meaning the contents of the page in question. A simple method of adding new pages and managing the organization of those pages into a simple hierarchy (outline). Support for multiple mini web sites so that you can write a lot about different topics. HAXCMS is only intended to be a micro-site generator and play nicely with the rest of the HAX ecosystem without needing a monster CMS in order to utilize it.

## Install
Download, checkout and get this package on a server (this is a PHP based implementation so your server should have PHP and Apache or Nginx at minimum). Go to the project root and type `bash scripts/haxtheweb.sh` which will step you through configuration.

## Local development
node_modules directories are daisy-chained back to the root repo in the event you want to build or work on your own theme / elements.

A `_config/my-custom-elements.js` file allows you to reference your own elements and do custom build routines. While HAXcms is intended to be used without needing to understand any of this, it's positioned to allow JS devs take it and run.

The easiest workflow for developing custom things in HAXcms:
- Add new dependendices to package.json, via `yarn install`
- Reference modifications in `_config/my-custom-elements.js`
- `cd _sites/mysite` and then run `polymer serve --npm --open --entrypoint dist/dev.html`
- Change address to `http://127.0.0.1:8081/` (or whatever IP and port was assigned in previous step)
- Changes will be reflected on browser reload when you change your assets


## Usage
Go to `yoursite.com` and login with the username and password you entered in the `config.php` by clicking on the login icon
